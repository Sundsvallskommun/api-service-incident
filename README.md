## Usage

### API Endpoints

Refer to the [API Documentation](#api-documentation) for detailed information on available endpoints.

### Example Request

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/2281/incident/1
```

## Configuration

Configuration is crucial for the application to run successfully. Ensure all necessary settings are configured in `application.yml`.

### Key Configuration Parameters

- **Server Port:**

  ```yaml
  server:
    port: 8080
  ```
- **Database Settings:**

  ```yaml
  spring:
    datasource:
      url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database
      username: your_db_username
      password: your_db_password
  ```
- **External Service URLs:**

  ```yaml
  config:
    integration:
      messaging:
        token-url: https://your_token.url
        client-id: your_client_id
        client-secret: your_client_secret
        url: https://integration.url
        sender:
          address: sender@email.se
          name: Sender Name
          reply-to: replyTo@email.se
      lifebuoy:
          apikey: your_api_key
          url: https://integration.url
  ```

### Database Initialization

The project is set up with [Flyway](https://github.com/flyway/flyway) for database migrations. Flyway is disabled by default so you will have to enable it to automatically populate the database schema upon application startup.

```yaml
spring:
  flyway:
    enabled: true
```

- **No additional setup is required** for database initialization, as long as the database connection settings are correctly configured.

### Additional Notes

- **Application Profiles:**

  Use Spring profiles (`dev`, `prod`, etc.) to manage different configurations for different environments.

- **Logging Configuration:**

  Adjust logging levels if necessary.
